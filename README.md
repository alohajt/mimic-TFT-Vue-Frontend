mimic-TFT is a website aiming to introduce a game called Teamfight Tactics(TFT) which was developed and published by Riot Games.
I was inspired to make it a website since I'm a gamer on TFT.

# Challenges
I ended up relearning HTML and CSS since this webpage is long and sections can have many layers of elements.

# Future Implementation
Make this website responsive to deffirent screen sizes.
